# Chess Experiments Plan

Based on the user's query, here are some first steps to expand the project:

## 1. UI for Watching Games in Review
- Choose a UI framework: For simplicity, use a web-based UI with Go's net/http or a framework like Gin.
- Implement a basic web server that can load and display chess games from PGN format.
- Use a JavaScript chessboard library like chessboard.js for the frontend.
- Create a new directory `web/` for UI-related code.

## 2. Traditional Algorithms
- Implement basic search algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- Integrate with the existing evaluator.
- Create a new package `engine/` for chess engine logic.
- Add functions for move generation and search.

## 3. Report on NN and ML Algorithms
- Research and document approaches like:
  - Neural Network evaluators (e.g., similar to Stockfish NNUE).
  - Reinforcement Learning like AlphaZero.
  - LLM-based move suggestion.
- Create REPORT.md with findings and recommendations.

## 4. Implementation Steps
- Start with traditional engine.
- Then add ML components, possibly using libraries like Gonum for ML or TensorFlow Go bindings.
- Test with sample games and evaluate performance.
